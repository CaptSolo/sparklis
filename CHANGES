[lisql] conversion  focus <--> elt_s * path
- elt_s_path_of_focus : focus -> unit elt_s * path
  // decomposes a query focus AtX (x,ctx) into the whole query (without focus), and a path to the focus
- focus_of_elt_s_path : unit elt_s * path -> focus
  // the inverse function
  // composes a whole query and a path into a query focus AtX (x,ctx)
those functions can be used to recover a precise focus from a permalink, which does not contain the focus location
